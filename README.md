# My Résumé (and template)

My [résumé](https://github.com/venkatasg/resume) is primarily based on ModernCV and [Butterick's guidelines](https://practicaltypography.com/resumes.html) with some modifications.

Feel free to use my template &mdash; you'll need to use LuaTeX and have the required fonts installed to use as-is.
