I am a Ph.D. candidate in Computational Linguistics at UT Austin studying intergroup bias in online communication. Previously, I have studied how individuals perform pragmatic acts like giving advice, worked on unsupervised methods for detecting data drift in NLU models, and surveyed the diversity of generalizations available across predicates and arguments in English.
