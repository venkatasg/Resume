I have 5+ years of experience in \textbf{Natural Language Processing} (NLP) including large language models, and am interested in  \textbf{Machine Learning} and \textbf{Data Science} roles with a focus on customer facing products built in collaborative work environments, with a \emph{start date in June 2024}.
