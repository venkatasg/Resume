I am a Ph.D. candidate at UT Austin researching intergroup bias in online communication. I have 5+ years of experience in data science, machine learning, and modern \textbf{Natural Language Processing} including large language models. I'm interested in roles at the intersection of \textbf{engineering, data science, and machine learning}, with a \emph{start date in June 2024}.
